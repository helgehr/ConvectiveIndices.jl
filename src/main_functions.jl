	calc_CAPE_thetae (ps[hPa], tks[K], qs[kg/kg], zs[m], parcel, dp_mix[hPa], dp_intp[hPa], kiss) 

Calculate convective indices such as **CAPE** and **CIN** for a parcel of choice (surface/most unstable, with/without vertical mixing), using a theta-e formulation.

# Examples

```jldoctest 
julia> LI, CAPE, CIN = calc_CAPE_theta(ps,tks,qs,zs) # most unstable parcel, mixed over 50 hPa (default)

```

**OUTPUT** for FULL=1: \n
Lifted Index [°C], CAPE [J/kg], CIN [J/kg], pLCL [hPa], Buoyant Condensation Level [m], CAPE-CIN above the LCL [J/kg], CIN below LCL [J/kg], MRH (mean RH%) above the LCL [%], MRH 600-800 hPa, MRH 300-600 hPa \n

**INPUT**:
(N-element ARRAYs) **ps**,**tks**,**qs**,**zs** = vertical profiles of pressure, temperature, specific humidity and geopotential height \n
OPTIONAL keyword arguments: \n
`parcel = 1` : the most unstable parcel in the lowest 350 hPa (default) \n
`parcel = 2` : surface parcel, or parcel from the lowest level \n
`dp_mix = 0...100` : pressure layer depth [hPa] for mixing the source parcel (default 50, use 0 for no mixing) \n
`dp_intp = 5` linearly interpolate to a uniform pressure grid with resolution dp (default 5). Use 0 to skip. This is a lot faster, but disables mixing and FULL option,
and is not recommended for low-resolution input. \n
`FULL = 1`: Full calculations to include also less known convective predictors, which were found useful in [1]. \n

This routine uses an `equivalent potential temperature formulation` for all indices (similarly to ECMWF CAPE), avoiding vertical loops altogether. 
This results in larger absolute values (e.g. for CAPE, 30% larger) than classic computations, but in no worse correlation with observed convection [1].

NOTE: Default option `parcel=1` and `dp_mix=50` corresponds to a hybrid mixed-layer most-unstable parcel similar to the one used by ECMWF. The MLMU-Lifted Index was the overall
thunderstorm index for Europe in [1].

```
where the input variables are `descending columns` of: pressure [hPa], temperature [K], specific humidity [kg/kg] and height [m],
returns the `diluted CAPE` using a constant mass entrainment rate. The code is adapted from the subroutine buoyan_dilute (by Richard Neale) 
in the CAM model. The effect of freezing/condensation on parcel temperature can be accounted for by toggling freezing=1. This is about 
twice as slow and the resulting dilute CAPE actually had lower correlation with observed thunderstorms in Sri Lanka (than using freezing=0).

The parcel is launched from the level with the highest theta-e in the lowest 350 hPa of the atmosphere. Optionally, the index can be specified by the user: 
calc_dilute_CAPE(ps,tks,qs,zs,parcel_index=30), would use a surface parcel if length(ps) = 30 and the last level is the surface.
